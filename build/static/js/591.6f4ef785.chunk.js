Rashi explains that Dovid expected that it would be dark for him in Olam Habah because of his sin with Bas Sheva. In the end, even Olam Hazeh became light for him when it was shown that he was forgiven in front of his detractors when the doors of the Beis HaMikdash would not open until Shlomo Hamelech mentioned they should open in the merit of Dovid.

So too in our case, we can assume that the chuldah with the chametz dragged it into a house that was not checked, and the chuldah with the matzah dragged the matzah into the house that was checked.

This is why they required an eruvei tavshilin, to be a heker to remind people that cooking on Yom Tov for after Yom Tov, is only permitted for Shabbos.Rabbah challenged Rav Chisda from a Mishnah in Menachos that states that the lechem hapanim is eaten on the ninth, tenth or eleventh day after it is baked. It is typically eaten on the ninth day since it is baked erev Shabbos and eaten the following Shabbos. If a Yom Tov falls on erev Shabbos it is eaten on the tenth day.

Rebbe Yirmiyah told him that this is not a good comparison. Lo lishmo is an invalidating kavanah by all the zevachim, whereas lishmo is only an invalidating kavanah for a pesach.

It might be thought that one who is eating the pesach, may eat it in two places, therefore, the passuk states, \\"\u05d1\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\\" \u2013 in one house shall he eat it.

Tosafos explain that according to Rebbe Yose, he need not interrupt the meal for the eating after nightfall is considered one of the Shabbos meals. The Kiddush that would be recited immediately afterward is viewed as having been recited upon that meal.The Gemara relates that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, Rebbe Yehudah, and Rebbe Yose were once eating a meal together when Shabbos began.

Tosafos note that nowadays, where it is customary for everybody to eat together on a large table, it is not practical to bring the table out after kiddush. Therefore, it is our custom to set the table with challos before kiddush, but to cover them until after kiddush.

This means that one should not eat an even number of the same food or an even number of the same beverage.

Eating in pairs enables demons or sorceresses to harm a person. The Gemara there brings three answers to how the Rabbanon could have instituted drinking four cups of wine on seder night, being that four is an even number.On our Daf, Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna were lenient, and both said, \\"\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd\\" \u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d8\u05e8\u05e3 \u05dc\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05e6\u05d8\u05e8\u05e3 \u2013 Shalom, meaning, the seventh cup which corresponds to the seventh word in the last berachah of birkas Kohanim, combines with the other six cups he drank for good, but does not combine with drinking an eighth cup for bad. Therefore, there is no danger in drinking eight cups. The Rashbam explains that since Hakadosh Boruch Hu chose to convey His berachos to the Jewish people through the seventh word, shalom, no harm in the world can come of it. The Gemara brings Rabbah and Rav Yosef who applied the fifth word of the middle berachah, \u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05e0\u05da, the same way, and that therefore there is no harm when drinking six cups, and then Abaye and Rava applied the third word, \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05da, in the first berachah similarly, and that there is therefore no harm in drinking four cups.

Rebbe Akiva says that neither blessing exempts a person from his obligation to say the other one.The Rashbam explains that the Torah requires that the blood of a Korban Pesach be poured on the wall of the mizbei\u2019ach and that the blood of the chagigah be thrown on two corners of the mizbei\u2019ach from a distance.
