The Maharsha (Brachos 64a) explains that one who davens with a multitude and learns with a multitude, meaning that he learns with a group and not alone, will be zocheh to be with the multitude of Jews appearing before Hashem in the Beis Hamikdash on the regalim. Rav Chiya bar Ashi said in the name of Rav, \u05ea\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd \u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0 \u2013 Talmidei Chochomim have no rest even in Olam Habah, as it is written, \\"\u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc \u05d0\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9\u05dc \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df\\" \u2013 They go from multitude to multitude, each appears before Hashem in Tziyon. The multitudes in the passuk refers to those who will be learning Torah before Hashem in Olam Habah."}],"siman":{"title":"Cot","paragraph":"The man finally succeeded in yanking the knotted ropes through a hole in the cot,\xa0while his friend lay the deceased on it and said \\"\u05dc\u05da \u05d1\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd\\" before he\xa0departed back to his city, just as the multitudes in the city of burial were leaving shul and heading to the\xa0Beis Hamidrash."}}]')}}]);
