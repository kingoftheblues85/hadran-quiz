Rebbe Yehudah says it is kosher. The Gemara asks what is unique about the case of a Succah, where the Tanna uses the word \u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, whereas in a Mishnah in Eruvin, regarding a korah at the entrance of a mavoi \u05ea\u05e0\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e7\u05e0\u05ea\u05d0 \u2013 the Tanna states a remedy on how to adjust the korah that is too high, by lowering it? Two answers are given. Since a succah is a d\u2019Oraysa, meaning that the halachah was taught at Har Sinai, the Tanna used the language of \u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, since it was not made according to its proper specification. However, the halachah requiring the adjustment of a mavoi is a d\u2019Rabbanon, therefore, the Tanna can only state a remedy. Rashi explains that the term \u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 is inappropriate here since there is no preexisting restriction on the height of the korah. The Mishnah itself is the very source of the \u201ctwenty-amos\u201d pessul. An alternative answer is that it would be appropriate to state a remedy for a d\u2019Oraysa as well, except that in regard to a succah \u05d3\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 \u2013 whose details are numerous, the Mishnah would be too lengthy if it would state a remedy for each case.

Rav Nachman says that the succah is kosher, and Rav Chisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna hold that it is passul. Rashi explains that Rav Chisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna hold that any decoration four tefachim away from the s\u2019chach, is viewed as independent of the s\u2019chach above it, and therefore the person sleeping inside the sukkah is considered beneath a tent formed by the sheet, and not in the succah proper.

Rashi explains that since one cannot derive \u05d4\u05e0\u05d0\u05d4 from orlah it has no value at all, and therefore, is not considered \u201chis own\u201d to fulfill \u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05d7\u05ea\u05dd \u05dc\u05db\u05dd.

They disagree whether it requires a \u05d3\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05de\u05d5\u05df. The nafka minah is an esrog of maaser sheini that is inside Yerushalayim according to Rebbe Meir.

The crown of the stem is the \u05e9\u05d5\u05e9\u05e0\u05ea\u05d0. If the pitam is missing the esrog is passul because it is considered \u05d7\u05e1\u05e8, deficient.

The Mishnah in Shabbos refers to where there is enough time in the day to finish the meal and daven, whereas our Mishnah is dealing with when there is not enough time to finish and take the lulav.When Rava suggested that a more obvious distinction is that one must interrupt for lulav because it is a d\u2019Oraysa, whereas davening is only a d\u2019Rabbanon, Rebbe Zeira said the case of the lulav was on the second day of the chag. The Gemara says this is implied, since the Mishnah said, \u201che was traveling on the way,\u201d which cannot be done on the first day of Yom Tov."},{"id":1,"title":"Major Halachos that can be learned from the current custom of reciting Hallel","paragraph":"The next Mishnah discusses the mitzvah of Hallel.

Rashi explains that the custom in Rava\u2019s time changed considerably from when Hallel was instituted by the Neviim. Originally, not everyone was proficient in reading, so the Neviim established the minhag for one person to recite Hallel, and the others would listen and respond Halleluyah after each phrase. By Rava\u2019s time, most people were proficient enough to recite Hallel on their own in unison with the ba\u2019al tefillah, except in certain places. The first halachah of six that Rava mentioned was that the ba\u2019al tefillah would recite the first word, Halleluyah, and the people would respond Halleluyah. \u05de\u05db\u05d0\u05df \u05e9\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4 \u2013 From here it can be inferred that it is a mitzvah to respond Halleluyah at the beginning of Hallel."},{"id":2,"title":"The source for \u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e2 \u05db\u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4","paragraph":"Rebbe Shimon be Pazi said the following statement in the name of Rebbe Yehoshua ben Levi who said it in the name of Bar Kappara: \u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e2 \u05db\u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u2013 From where is it derived that listening is like responding and that one has fulfilled his chiyuv?

The Gemara challenges this, based on a Baraisa that taught that when one enters the succah during the chag to sit in it, he makes the berachah of \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d1\u05e1\u05d5\u05db\u05d4, \u05d5\u05db\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05da \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05da \u2013 and once he has recited this berachah on the first day of the chag, he does not recite the berachah on the subsequent days. The Gemara answers that the question of whether a berachah on the succah is recited all seven days, is dependent on a machlokes Tannaim regarding tefillin. For it was taught in a Baraisa, \u05ea\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05df \u05db\u05dc \u05d6\u05de\u05df \u05e9\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05da \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05df \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u2013 Rebbe said that tefillin, every time one dons them, one recites a berachah over them. And the Chochomim say, \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05da \u05d0\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05dc\u05d1\u05d3 \u2013 one recites a berachah in the morning only, no more than once a day. We see that according to Rebbe, one recites multiple berachos in a single day. Similarly, Rebbe Yochanan holds, that although all seven days of Succos are regarded as one long \u201cday\u201d, since the succah obligation is day and night, one recites berachos all seven days."},{"id":1,"title":"\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4","paragraph":"It was taught in a Baraisa, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 \\"\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d4\'...\u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\\" \u2013 If there are many mitzvos before a person to be performed, which Rashi explains could mean one who is ready to take a lulav, dwell in a succah, don tefillin and wrap himself in a tallis, he recites a berachah \u201cand has commanded us regarding His mitzvos\\". Rebbe Yehudah says that he recites a berachah over each and every mitzvah individually. Rebbe Zeira said, and some say that it was Rebbe Chanina bar Pappa who said, that Rebbe Yehudah\u2019s reason is based on the passuk, \\"\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\' \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd\\" \u2013 Blessed is Hashem day by day.

The Gemara objects to this answer since the case of forty-eight blasts that our Mishnah mentions is when erev Shabbos falls during Succos. Sometimes it does not occur, such as when the first day of Succos falls on erev Shabbos!

Why is it postponed? Since if the first day of Succos falls out on erev Shabbos, then Yom Kippur would have been on the previous Sunday. In order to prevent that from happening, we add a day to Elul in order to postpone it one day. Rashi explains that it is not desirable for Yom Kippur to follow Shabbos, since anyone dying on Shabbos would remain unburied for two days until after Yom Kippur. Furthermore, any vegetables that one prepares to eat after Yom Kippur will have to be picked two days earlier, on Friday, and will wilt by the time they are needed.
