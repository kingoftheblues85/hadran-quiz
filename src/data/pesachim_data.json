Rashi explains that the bedikah is done so one does not transgress the prohibitions of בל יראה ובל ימצא – You may not see chametz in your possession, and you may not find chametz in your possession. The Gemara begins by asking, מאי אור – What is the meaning of “or”? Rav Huna says נגהי – it means light, which the Gemara presently understands to mean daytime, and Rav Yehudah says, לילי – it means night. Rashi explains that according to Rav Huna, one would begin the bedikah when it begins to get light in the morning of the fourteenth. A candle is used because the sky is mostly dark at that time. The Gemara poses several challenges to each position."

The Gemara answers that the passuk means, הללוהו כל כוכבים המאירים – Praise him, all the stars that give light. The Gemara asks that even the stars that do not give light should praise HaKadosh Baruch Hu and explains that really all of the stars do praise Hashem. Rather the passuk means to teach, דאור כוכבים נמי אור הוא – that the light of the stars is also called ‘or’. This is relevant in regard to if someone made a neder not to benefit from ‘or’, it would be forbidden to him to benefit from the light of the stars."

        "paragraph": "The Gemara challenged Rav Yehudah from the passuk, ואמר אך חשך ישופני ולילה אור בעדני – I had said, “Only darkness will shadow me,” but the night became ‘or’ around me. Rashi explains that Dovid Hamelech thought that he would die in the darkness of his troubles, but then night became day for him, and his troubles disappeared. Since ‘or’ is contrasted with night, it seemingly means day. The Gemara answers that what Dovid meant was, אני אמרתי אך חשך ישופני לעולם הבא – I had said, “Only darkness would shadow me even in the World to Come, שהוא דומה ליום – which is analogous to day,”עכשיו העולם הזה שהוא דומה ללילה אור בעדני – But now, even this world which is analogous to night, has become light around me. Rashi explains that Dovid expected that it would be dark for him in Olam Habah because of his sin with Bas Sheva. In the end, even Olam Hazeh became light for him when it was shown that he was forgiven in front of his detractors when the doors of the Beis HaMikdash would not open until Shlomo Hamelech mentioned they should open in the merit of Dovid. Therefore, the meaning of the word “or” here does not mean day, but rather light."

By writing ‘that are not tahor’, rather than just tamei, the Torah demonstrates the importance of refined speech.

One answer is to say instead שחץ פסול, meaning that he displayed some disqualifying arrogance. Since he disparaged the offerings when he spoke, he is unfit to serve. The second answer is that here his lineage was checked again because he had compromised himself. Rashi explains that the way that he spoke indicated that he had not been checked out properly in the first place and a therefore a new investigation was required."

The Gemara suggests that it is due to the rule of זריזין מקדימין למצוות – People who have alacrity do mitzvos as early as possible, but questions that answer, being that this rule only means that one should do a mitzvah as far back as that morning, but not the night before. The Gemara shows this from the fact that Avraham left for the Akeida in the morning, but not the night before.

Abaye explains that these passukim are contradictory because if chametz cannot be in one’s house for seven days, then how is one supposed to burn it on the first of the seven days? Rather, says Abaye, the word ראשון here is referring to the day before, meaning that the passuk is saying to burn the chametz a day before Pesach, on the 14th.The Gemara brings another source for this that ראשון here means the day before, as the Beis Medrash of Rebbe Yishmael have a Baraisa that states that we find that the 14th day is called ראשון in the Torah, as it says  בראשון בארבעה עשר יום לחדש – On the first, on the 14th day of the month.A third source is brought from Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak, who says that the word ראשון means the day prior to, not the first day, of the chag, as it says in the passukהראשון אדם תולד – Were you born prior to Adam?"

Therefore, on the fourteenth we are concerned that the chuldah took away the chametz and hid it. Rava and Rav Mari give two other answers."

Two mice came, and one took from the pile of matzah and one took from the pile of chametz, and each one entered a different house, and we don’t know which one entered which house. The Gemara says that this is comparable to a case of a Baraisa that says that if there were two baskets, one full of chullin fruit and one full of fruits of terumah, and next to them were two containers, one holding fruits of chullin and one holding fruits of terumah, and each one of these containers fell into a different basket, then we assume that the chullin fell into the chullin and the terumah fell into the terumah. So too in our case, we can assume that the chuldah with the chametz dragged it into a house that was not checked, and the chuldah with the matzah dragged the matzah into the house that was checked. The Gemara concludes that the Rabbanan were lenient because both cases involved a d’Rabbanon. Terumah nowadays is a d’Rabbanon and bedikas chametz is a d’Rabbanon."

If all three piles were searched and still no trace of tumah is found, Rebbe Meir said, כל דבר שבחזקת טומאה לעולם הוא בטומאתו – Anything that has a chazakah of being tamei is always assumed to be in its state of tumah, עד שיודע לך הטומאה היכן היא – until it becomes known to you where the tumah is. The Chochomim say, בודק עד שמגיע לסלע או לקרקע בתולה – He should search until he reaches a layer of rock or virgin ground, and if the tumah is not found, he may assume it is no longer there. Rashi explains that he may assume a raven or mouse came and removed them. In the case of chametz, even Rebbe Meir would agree that the house need not be searched again, since the requirement is only a d’Rabbanon.

According to Shmuel, Yosef ben Yoezer holds that tumas mashkin is a d'Oraysah in that the mashkin itself can become tamei but being able to metamei something else is only a d’Rabbanon. This d’Rabbanon was a decree on mashkin outside the Beis HaMikdash, not inside."

This Baraisa says that the blood of a korban is mekabel tumah. Clearly, then, Yosef ben Yoezer meant to exclude the mashkin in the butchering place only from contaminating other things, for only this law is d’Rabbanon, but mashkin are mekabel tumah mid’Oraysa?The Gemara answers that mashkin are only mekabel tumah mid’Rabbanon, and this Baraisa, which holds that the Rabbanon imposed tumah susceptibility even upon the butchering place mashkin, does not accord with the opinion of Yosef ben Yoezer."

He asked them, in a nutshell, whether kodesh can become a revii and they answered that it cannot. Rav said they erred, and Shmuel said they did not. Shmuel understood the question differently, that Chaggai had asked whether kodesh can become a chamishi, which it cannot. Rav’s opinion is challenged based another time when Chaggai asked them a similar question whether kodshim can become a revii, but this time where the source of tumah is a person who is tamei from a meis, instead of the source of tumah being a sheretz, which was the first question, and they answered the question correctly that it is tamei. It must be therefore, that the first question was about a chamishi, like Shmuel understood. The Gemara gives two answers. Rav Nachman said in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha,בקיאין הן בטומאת מת ואין בקיאין בטומאת שרץ - They were knowledgeable in the halachos of tumas meis but not in the halachos of tumas sheretz, to know that it would make kodesh a revii.

Rashi explains that they cannot be metamei other things just like they could not while they were within the azarah. The reason is that since they were considered mashkin of the mizbeyach at the time of their becoming tamei, and therefore not able to be metamei others, they retain that status even after going out of the Beis Hamikdash. However, they themselves become tamei, since as the Gemara clarified earlier, that Levi holds that mashkin of the mizbeyach can become tamei.

Rashi explains that if a long trough has foods of kodesh at either end that are not touching each other, and one who is tamei touched the food at one end, even the kodesh food at the other end is tamei, because the trough combines them as one entity.  There is a machlokes whether צירוף is d’Oraysa or d’Rabbanon.Rebbe Yochanan holds that it is a d’Rabbanon based on a Mishnah from Eduyos that states that Rebbe Akiva said that if a tevul yom touched part ofסולת -  fine flour of kodesh, or ketores, or levonah, or coals, פסל את כולן - he has passuled the entire heap. We see from here that tziruf is a d’Rabbanon because levonah and coals are inedible, and therefore can only become tamei mid’Rabbanon.Rebbe Chanin holds tziruf is a d’Oraysa based on the passuk, כף אחת עשרה זהב מלאה קטרת – One gold ladle worth ten shekels, filled with ketores, הכתוב עשה כל מה שבכף אחת – the Torah made everything that is in the ladle into one entity.

Whereas the external moisture on food gives it the finishing touch that gives it the status of food, the special esteem in which kodesh is held elevates it to the status of food thereby enabling it to be mekabel tumah without the addition of moisture. The Gemara rejects this answer since chibas hakodesh effects tumah only in regard to making the kodesh itself unfit for consumption, but not to act as a machshir to giving something else the capacity to be mekabel tumah.

Yet, it is stated in a Mishnah,ציידי חיה ועופות ודגים – With regard to trappers of beasts, birds and fish, שנזדמנו להם מינין טמאין – where species of impure creatures happened into their traps, מותרין למוכרן לנכרים– they may sell these creatures to nochrim. It is clear from here that one may derive benefit from them even though one is prohibited from eating them. The Gemara answered,שלכם יהא שאני התם דאמר קרא \"לכם\"- The law regarding sheratzim is different and therefore, an exception to the rules of Chizkiya and Rebbe Abahu for the verse states, “and they shall be an abomination to you” – This terminology implies that they shall be yours to use."

The Gemara answers that it is written that if the blood of an outer chatas is mistakenly brought into the קודש of the Beis HaMikdash for sprinkling, באש תשרף - that the chatas must be burned. The Gemara teaches that אם אינו ענין לגופו דכתיב והנה שורף - Since that passuk is not needed for itself as we already know that it must be burned from another passuk that saysוהנה שורף – behold it shall be burned, the passuk can be used to teach us that it is forbidden to eat chametz on Pesach and that it is forbidden to eat of an animal that was stoned. And since we do not need a passuk to teach us that it is forbidden to eat these foods, as we already know this from other passukim, therefore the passuk will teach us that it is forbidden to even get הנאה from these foods. Rashi explains that this way of learning a passuk to be going on some other halachah entirely, is one of the ways to be doresh and is a הלכה למשה מסיני."

Abaye on this Daf attempts to use the same passukim that were initially mentioned but he reverses Rebbe Yehoshua’s reasoning. Let the Torah write only, באש תשרף– it, the chatas, should be burned in the fire, and it does not need to state,לא תאכל – it shall not be eaten. Rashi explains that if it must be burned then it obviously cannot be eaten. And if לא תאכל is not applicable here in its own context, let it be the source, based on Rebbe Elazar’s principle for darshaning, for all other prohibited items in the Torah that it is also prohibited to derive benefit from them.Rav Pappa said to Abaye that perhapsלא תאכל  comes to state a לא תעשה specifically for the chatas itself, because if the negative commandment was only learned through Rebbe Elazar’s rule, one would not receive malkus, because אין לוקין על לאו שבכללות – one does not incur lashes for transgressing a generalized prohibition.

Does it need to be ground up before throwing it to the wind or into the sea, or only when thrown to the wind?Rabbah said that it seems most reasonable to say that avodah zarah which in that Mishnah is discussing throwing it specifically into the Yam Hamelech for disposal, does not require grinding before being cast into it, but chametz, which our Mishnah is discussing throwing in into other rivers, requires crumbling before being cast into the river. Rashi explains that in the Yam Hamelech there are no boats passing, and hence no concern that travelers will pick it up. Rav Yosef said the opposite is more reasonable.

Meaning, that just as one is restricted from seeing his chametz but he may see the chametz of nochrim and hekdesh, so too only your leaven you may not eat but one may eat that of nochrim and hekdesh.

The Gemara answers that the above case was referring to a metal oven, whereas Rav was referring to earthenware. Alternatively, both were earthenware, but in the above case it was a stove, which is fired on the inside where the heat is more intense, whereas Rav’s case was a pot, which is fired from the outside."

Rashi explains that since the chametz is deposited by the nochri, and he does not need to take any further action in order to gain possession of it, we consider that he takes possession of the chametz retroactively from the time it was deposited with him.Related to this, the Gemara introduces a machlokes regarding a creditor who holds a mortgage on a borrower’s property. Abaye said, בעל חוב למפרע הוא גובה – If the borrower defaults on the debt, theבעל חוב collects the property retroactively, whereas Rava said, מכאן ולהבא הוא גובה – He collects the property only from here on. The Gemara clarifies that they argue in a case where the בעל חוב either sold or was makdish the property before the loan came due. Abaye holds that once the borrower defaulted, it emerges retroactively that the property was in the lender’s possession all along.

The Gemara seeks the source for this ruling.Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak brought the passuk regarding terumah that states, תתן לו – you shall give it to him, meaning to the Kohen, ולא לאורו – but not to his fire. This teaches that produce can become terumah only if it is fit for the Kohen to eat. If it can only be used for burning, then it cannot acquire the kedushah of terumah. Even Rebbe Yose Ha’Glili who permits getting hana’ah from chametz on Pesach would agree here, since the Kohen is not permitted to eat it.Rav Huna brei d’Rav Yehoshua learns it from the fact that terumah is referred to as ראשית – the first of your gathered grain, which implies, ששיריה ניכרין לישראל – that after terumah is taken, its remains must be distinguishable to a Yisroel, meaning that it must become permitted to a Yisroel.

This is derived from the passuk regarding terumah that states, משמרת תרומתי, which means that the Kohanim have been given the responsibility to safeguard terumah, and kodshim as well, from becoming tamei, and this requires one not to allow his attention to lapse from this guarding. Since these plants became tamei, it can be assumed that the Kohen stopped guarding them against further exposure to tumah, and therefore they became rendered invalid. Therefore, even though the tumah is removed through the replanting, they remain invalid to eat.The Gemara brings a machlokes about hesech hadaas. Rebbe Yochanan says, פסול טומאה הוי – It is a passul caused by the possibility of tumah. If, therefore, Eliyahu would come and pronounce that the terumah never became tamei, it will be permitted to eat it. Reish Lakish said it is,פסול הגוף הוי – It is a pesul of the terumah itself. Therefore, even if Eliyahu would come and say that the terumah never became tamei, it would still be forbidden to eat it since the terumah is invalid regardless of whether it acquired tumah.

The Chachomim hold that it is ממון הדיוט, personal property.Rav Assi continues that this machlokes regarding maaser sheini between Rebbe Meir and the Chachomim applies to matzos made from maaser sheini, and also to an esrog of maaser sheini, where Rebbe Meir says one cannot fulfill his obligation with them and the Chachomim say that one can. The passuk regarding an esrog states, ולקחתם לכם – and you should take for yourselves, implying that an esrog must be your own.

The practical difference between these two sources isצלי קדר – a pesach made as pot roast, where it is only cooked in its own fat.

Now if according to Rebbe Akiva איסור והיתר מצרטפין – forbidden and permitted foods combine, as derived from משרת  – איסור ואיסור מיבעיא – is it necessary for the Torah to state that the forbidden combines with the forbidden?

To destroy the challah by burning it or feeding it to an animal, is also forbidden becauseאין שורפין קדשים ביום טוב - it is forbidden to burn sacred food on Yom Tov.Rebbe Eliezer says, לא תקרא לה שם עד שתאפה – The woman baking it should not designate a portion as challah until after it is baked. Ben Beseira says, תטיל בצונן – She should put the challah in cold water, since this prevents the challah from becoming chametz. Rebbe Yehoshua says that this is not the category of chametz that one transgresses בל יראה ובל ימצא, since he is not considered the owner of this chametz.

The Gemara first suggests that they are arguing if טובת הנאה ממון, if the benefit that the owner retains by being able to select which Kohen to give the challah, and even the right to accept money from a friend or relative of the Kohen, is considered equity in the challah.

This is why they required an eruvei tavshilin, to be a heker to remind people that cooking on Yom Tov for after Yom Tov, is only permitted for Shabbos.Rabbah challenged Rav Chisda from a Mishnah in Menachos that states that the lechem hapanim is eaten on the ninth, tenth or eleventh day after it is baked. It is typically eaten on the ninth day since it is baked erev Shabbos and eaten the following Shabbos. If a Yom Tov falls on erev Shabbos it is eaten on the tenth day. On this, Rabbah asked Rav Chisda that if Mid’Oraysa צרכי שבת are done on Yom Tov, and it is only prohibited Mid’Rabbanon, why does the baking of the lechem hapanim not override the prohibitions of Yom Tov, as we have a rule that the injunctions of the Rabbanon, a shevus, do not apply in the Beis Hamikdash. Rav Chisda answered, שבות קרובה התירו שבות רחוקה לא התירו – They permitted a shevus for an immediate purpose, but they did not permit it for a distant purpose, meaning, for the eating of the lechem hapanim on the subsequent Shabbos.

Yet the Mishnah teaches they must be baked the day before!The Gemara answers that the halachah is different there, דאמר קרא \"לכם\", לכם ולא לגבוה – because the passuk regarding preparing food on Yom Tov says, “for you”, which teaches that you may prepare food on Yom Tov only for yourselves but not “for Hashem,” meaning, the offerings.

Rabbah understands that the passuk referring to preparation cannot be referring to cooking and baking since the Torah states elsewhere that they should cook or bake the mann.

Rabbah holds that he is not chayav since visitors might arrive that he can serve the food to on Yom Tov, whereas Rav Chisda holds that he is chayav since he does not hold of הואיל. On this Daf, Rami bar Chama said that this machlokes is the same as the one between Rebbe Eliezer and Rebbe Yehoshua in the Mishnah regarding separating challah from tamei dough on Pesach. Rebbe Eliezer holds like Rabbah, that we apply הואיל, and he may therefore bake the loaves since he could separate challah from each loaf separately. Rebbe Yehoshua holds like Rav Chisda, that we do not apply הואיל, and therefore he forbids the baking of all the loaves on Yom Tov.Rav Pappa said that perhaps Rebbe Eliezer applies הואיל only in the Mishnah’s case, because at the time that the loaves are put into the oven each and every one is fit for the baker himself. Rashi explains that Rebbe Eliezer may not hold of הואיל but is permitting it because at the time of baking we do not know which loaf will become challah. He may, however, forbid it in the case of baking on Yom Tov for weekday use, since it is not fit for himself since he finished his Yom Tov meals, and he does not apply הואיל since he has not invited guests and has no reason to anticipate their arrival.

Rava says the rule can apply to the former case, since when the locals see the newcomer not working, they will assume that it is because he is a בטלן, someone who sits idle and does not work."

When Abaye suggested to Rav Yosef that he should have given malkus to Rav Nassan instead, Rav Yosef replied, עדיפא עבדי ליה – I gave him the more severe punishment, for in Eretz Yisrael they vote to impose malkus on a yeshiva student who sins in a d’Rabbanon, ולא מימנו אשמתא – and they do not vote to excommunicate. Rashi explains that they try to avoid excommunicating a talmid as much as possible out of concern for kavod haTorah that the student represents. Since malkus is a less severe punishment, the publicity generated is not so damaging to the talmid’s reputation and the Torah’s honor. Rav Yosef excommunicated Rav Nassan because violating the second day of Yom Tov is a more serious offense. The Gemara brings a different version of this episode."

The marinating process renders the three species as one entity. Rebbe Yehoshua says we may eat all three until the last species is depleted. Since the two species that have become depleted have the flavor of the third, they do not require removal. Rabban Gamliel says, כל שכלה מינו מן השדה יבער מינו מן החבית – as each species becomes depleted in the field, one shall remove that species from the barrel.

The berachah is recited because the flame which had been forbidden to use, is now fully permitted.

The Gemara concludes that Rebbe Yochanan holds that on a taanis tzibbur, reciting ne’ilah is a chiyuv, whereas on Tisha b’Av it is a reshus.

Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, לעולם יעשה אדם עצמו תלמיד חכם – In such matters any person can accustom himself like a talmid chachom. The Gemara infers that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is not concerned about the person appearing haughty, while the Rabbanon are concerned.

Rav Shisha bar Idi said that they should not, and answered the contradiction that the Rabbanon hold that since everyone else is working on Tisha b’Av it appears haughty not to, whereas since everybody else is saying Shema the chosson does not stand out. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that the chosson appears haughty because we know he cannot have the proper kavanah on his wedding night, whereas people will attribute a person not working on Tisha b’Av as someone merely sitting idle due to lack of work."

Rava objected saying that perhaps only shelamim cannot be brought after the tamid shel bein ha’arbaim but olos could be brought. Instead, Rava explained,\"השלמים\" עליה השלם כל הקרבנות כולן – the shelamim, on it, referring to the tamid shel bein ha’arbaim, complete (hashlem) all of the offerings."

Hence the pesach cannot be offered after the menorah is lit, and since the Torah states that we are to burn the ketores when the menorah is lit, the pesach precedes the ketores as well.

Even though he immersed himself on the seventh day, mid’Rabbonon he must be tovel a second time after bringing his korbanos in order to eat kodshim. Rebbe Yishmael beno shel Rebbe Yochanan ben Berokah says that aמחוסר כפורים may even do so the rest of the year to eat his kodshim at night. Rashi explains that he can do so because there is a mitzvah for one to partake of his korban. The Gemara asks how the mitzvah to eat one’s korban, where there is no liability of kares if he does not, can override the mitzvah of completing all the korbanos before the afternoon tamid? Ravina said in the name of Rav Chisda that we are dealing with a case of a חטאת העוף שאין למזבח אלא דמה – a bird chatas of an impoverished metzorah, the mizbeyach only gets its blood, and none of its body is burned there.

It would not be in accordance with Rebbe Meir who holds תפוס לשון ראשון – only one's first expression is binding, and therefore, since the Kohen began the avodah with the proper kavanah the offering would be valid, and the subsequent improper intention is not legally recognized. If the Mishnah meant the two kavanos were expressed during two avodos, then it could also accord according to Rebbe Meir. Rashi explains that since improper kavanah during any of the four avodos can invalidate the pesach, the fact that an earlier avodah was performed lishmah, has no bearing if a subsequent avodah was performed shelo lishmah.

The difference between the two cases of the Mishnah, is that the reisha was dealing with a case,דקאי בשחיטה וקא מחשב בשחיטה – where he is standing at the shechita and having kavanah about the shechita, or he is standing at the zerikah and having kavanah about the zerikah, whereas the seifa refers to a case, דקאי בשחיטה וקחשיב בזריקה – where he is standing at the shechitah and having kavanah about the zerikah, that he says,הריני שוחט את הפסח לשמו לזרוק דמו שלא לשמו – “I am hereby shechting the pesach for its own sake in order to do zerikah shelo lishmah.” The Mishnah is coming to teach us דמחשבין מעבודה לעבודה – that one can effectively intend from one avodah to another avodah, and is an answer to Rav Pappa, who questioned in Zevachim if this is so."

Does the lo lishmo come and remove it from the status as a korban brought lishmo and machshir it, or not? Rav Dimi related that he stated the following argument before Rebbe Yirmiyah. He said, that just as a pesach brought on the 14th lo lishmo v’lishmo, the lishmo does not remove the status of lo lishmo, similarly a pesach brought the rest of the year, lishmo v’lo lishmo, the lo lishmo does not remove the lishmo status and it remains passul. Rebbe Yirmiyah told him that this is not a good comparison. Lo lishmo is an invalidating kavanah by all the zevachim, whereas lishmo is only an invalidating kavanah for a pesach.

Rav Pappa suggested to Rava, based on a comparison of שינוי בעלים to שינוי קדש, that שינוי בעלים during the rest of the year would be valid, and Rava responded that the cases are not analogous since they are different in four respects. With שינוי קדש, if one has in mind the wrong korban during any of the four avodos, the korban is passul, whereas the only avodah where שינוי בעלים is passul is with zerikah. Secondly, שינוי קדש applies בציבור וביחיד, with the regards to both communal and individual korbanos, whereas שינוי בעלים only applies to individual korbanos.

The Gemara brings the sources for both rulings. It was taught in a Baraisa, the Torah states that the pesach should be taken, במכסת, - according to the number of people. מלמד שאין הפסח נשחט אלא למנויו – This teaches that the pesach may be shechted only for those registered on it. One might think that if one shechted it for those not registered on it, יהא כעובר על המצוה וכשר – he should be considered merely like one who transgressed a mitzvah but the korban is valid, תלמוד לומר במכסת...תכסו – the Torah states, according to the number…shall you count. The passuk repeated the requirement to make it essential. Rebbe says, לשון סורסי הוא – the word תסכו is an Aramaic expression, like a person says to his friend, כוס לי טלה זה - shecht this lamb for me. The source that the pesach is pasul if it is shechted for those unable to eat it comes from a hekesh ofאוכלין למנויין – comparing those that eat it to those that register it as it says, איש לפי אכלו תכסו – each man according to what he eats shall you count."

Rav Chisda said that the korban is passul and Rabbah says that it is kasher.

Rabbah holds, חבירו דומיא דידיה – that the fellow that invalidates the korban must be similar to the owner.

After clarifying that the blood only spilled after first being received in a kli shareis, because הן כהנים זריזין, the Kohanim are diligent and catch the blood properly, which makes it fit to be applied to the altar, and even though the majority of the blood on the floor is דם התמצית – blood that drained out of the animal after the דם הנפש, the life blood, spurted out, and is not fit for the mizbeyach, Rebbe Yehuda follows his own reasoning where he says, אין דם מבטל דם – Blood cannot nullify blood.

They inquired if anyone knew of someone who was aware of the halachah, and were told that Hillel HaBavli, who served both Shemayah and Avtalyon, knows. When they asked him, Hillel responded,נאמר \"מועדו\" בפסח ונאמר \"מועדו\" בתמיד – It is stated, “in its appointed time” both in regard to the pesach and the tamid, from which we learn, that just as the tamid is docheh Shabbos so too the pesach is docheh Shabbos.

Rebbe Yochanan brought the passuk regarding those who are tamei that must postpone bringing their offerings until Pesach Sheini, איש איש כי יהיה טמא לנפש – Any man who will be tamei from a corpse.איש נדחה לפסח שני ואין ציבור נידחין לפסח שני אלא עבדי בטומאה – The passuk’s mention of the singular, any man, implies that only an individual is deferred until Pesach Sheini but a tamei tzibbur is not, rather they bring the pesach in a state of tumah. Reish Lakish rejected this pshat, suggesting that it could be interpreted that the tzibbur cannot bring in a state of tumah neither on pesach rishon or sheini. Rather, he brought the passuk, וישלחו מן המחנה כל צרוע וכל זב וכל טמא לנפש – And they must send from the camp, any metzorah, any zav and anyone contaminated by a corpse. Reish Lakish explained that the passuk could have just mentioned a טמא מת and it would be a kal v’chomer for zavim and metzorahs that they are also sent out, since their tumah is more stringent. Therefore, the reason they were included is to teach that there is a time when zavim and metzorahs are sent out of the azarah and tamei meisim are not sent out and remain to bring an offering, which is the pesach.

Rashi explains that Rebbe Yehoshua holds that a טועה בדבר מצוה פטור, one who errs (and transgresses) while attempting to perform a mitzvah, and who does in fact perform somewhat of a mitzvah (though not one that overrides Shabbos), is patur from a chatas. In this case, the person did perform somewhat of a mitzvah, since most korbanos brought לא לשמו are valid for their original designation. Rebbe Eliezer holds a טועה בדבר מצוה חייב – one who errs in a mitzvah is chayav. The Mishnah continues, with each Tanna defending his position."

Rashi explains that the person should have been more attentive to notice that the tamid was already brought and therefore it was not his attempt to perform a mitzvah that caused the error but rather his negligence in observing what had already been done. In the case of the pesach, since there are numerous offerings present, it is reasonable to assume that the lamb before him is a pesach. On this Daf the Gemara challenges whether Rebbe Yehoshua holds that wherever the mitzvah has a limit the person would be a chayav a chatas based on a Mishnah in Shabbos where Rebbe Yehoshua holds that if one had two infants, one to circumcise on erev Shabbos and one to circumcise on Shabbos and the person forgot and circumcised the erev Shabbos infant on Shabbos he would be patur since he wasטועה בדבר מצוה – he erred while attempting a mitzvah. Rebbe Ami answered that at the time he circumcised the infant, there was still the Shabbos infant that preoccupied him whereas in the case of the tamid, it had already been offered.

Rav Chisda said that this din makes sense if you say that an offerings designation requires akirah, and that it does not change automatically. In this case, the korban is still a pesach and since it has no owners, פסולו בגופו – its disqualification is in the offering itself and that it is why it requires immediate burning. But if you say that a korban does not require akirah, then at the moment the owners withdrew, it was a shelamim and the reason for its disqualification is because of an external factor, that it was shechted after the תמיד של בין ערביים. If that is the case, the korban requires a change of appearance, meaning time should pass so that the meat looks different from losing its moisture, and it should not be brought immediately. The Gemara will bring a number of attempts to resolve the contradiction between Rav and the Baraisa."

So how does the Kohen Gadol fulfill his chiyuv? מביא מן הלוחשות – he brings some of the flickering coals. We see from here that even flickering coals are not classified as fire, contradicting Rebbe. Rava resolves the contradiction by reinterpreting the Baraisa. If the Torah had only stated, גחלי – it might be thought he should bring smoldering coals, not flickering ones, therefore, it states אש. If it had only stated אש, it might be thought he may take a burning piece of wood that is half coal and half flame, so that by the time he enters the Kodesh Hakedoshim it should be entirely coal.

Rather, even if the meat became tamei, and the cheilev remains tahor, one does zerikas hadam. Rashi explains that even Rebbe Yehoshua agrees, since the zerikah permits the consumption of the cheilev on the mizbeyach."

The Rabbanon therefore decreed tumah on the hands, to be matriach the Kohen to immerse them, which would serve as a deterrent. The one who taught the reason for nossar, explained it was משום עצלי כהונה – because of lazy Kohanim. Rashi explains that the decree would spur lazy Kohanim to eat the meat, who might otherwise have let it become nossar. The question was asked whether the same decree was enacted for people taking the pesach beyond its boundary, and the Gemara concludes that there was no needבני חבורה זריזין הן ומזהיר זהירי ביה  - the members of the group that offer the pesach are zealous, and they are careful with the meat not to take it out if its boundary."

Just like Shabbos one is not chayav until he does an akirah v’hanachah so too here a person is not chayav until he does an akirah v’hanachah. Rebbe Abba bar Mammal challenged him from a Mishnah in Zevachim regarding carrying the carcasses of the inner chatas offerings on poles beyond the walls of the azarah, where those in the front are metamei their garments as soon as they emerge from the azarah, even though the offering has not yet come to rest on the ground. According to Rebbe Ami they should not be metamei their garments until they place it down? Rebbe Abba bar Mammal resolved his own question. בנגררין – The Mishnah is dealing with a case where the carcasses are dragging on the ground.  Tosafos says that it is lav davka that they were dragging. Rather the limbs hang down to within three tefachim of the ground and are deemed resting on the ground based on the principle of lavud."

It might be thought that the pesach may be initially eaten in two groups, therefore the passuk states, בבית אחד יאכל – In one house it shall be eaten.

If his animal, meaning the original pesach, was shechted first, he and they eat of his. Rashi explains that since they appointed him as their agent, they remain registered on it, and once it is shechted, they can no longer withdraw from it. Their offering is considered a pesach without an owner and is burned. If theirs was shechted first, they eat of theirs and he eats of his. If it is not known which one was shechted first, or if both were shechted at the same time, he eats of his, because, as Rashi explains, he was never registered on theirs. They do not eat of his because of the possibility that theirs was shechted first; in which case they would have withdrawn from his.ושלהן יצא לבית השריפה – And theirs is taken out to be burned, because of the possibility that his was offered first, ופטורין מלעשות פסח שני – And they are exempt from observing pesach sheini. Rashi explains that since one of them was brought for them, the safek only restricts their eating from one of them. but does not nullify their fulfillment of bringing the pesach, since eating is not me’akev for the mitzvah."

According to Rebbe Yehudah, the person must stop the meal, remove the table and recite birkas hamazon. The reason is that a meal must be brought to the table for the honor of Shabbos, or because the eating after nightfall would be viewed as an extension of the weekday meal. Tosafos explain that according to Rebbe Yose, he need not interrupt the meal for the eating after nightfall is considered one of the Shabbos meals. The Kiddush that would be recited immediately afterward is viewed as having been recited upon that meal.The Gemara relates that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, Rebbe Yehudah, and Rebbe Yose were once eating a meal together when Shabbos began. A discussion ensued about whether they should interrupt the meal or not and, eventually, לא זזו משם עד שקבעו הלכה כר' יוסי – They did not move from there until they established the halachah according to Rebbe Yose."

Tosafos note that nowadays, where it is customary for everybody to eat together on a large table, it is not practical to bring the table out after kiddush. Therefore, it is our custom to set the table with challos before kiddush, but to cover them until after kiddush.

This means that one should not eat an even number of the same food or an even number of the same beverage. Rabbeinu Bachya writes  that the avoidance of pairs is a concrete expression of our rejection of dualism, the heretical belief that there are two deities. Eating in pairs enables demons or sorceresses to harm a person. The Gemara there brings three answers to how the Rabbanon could have instituted drinking four cups of wine on seder night, being that four is an even number.On our Daf, Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna were lenient, and both said, \"שלום\" לטובה מצרטרף לרעה לא מצטרף – Shalom, meaning, the seventh cup which corresponds to the seventh word in the last berachah of birkas Kohanim, combines with the other six cups he drank for good, but does not combine with drinking an eighth cup for bad. Therefore, there is no danger in drinking eight cups. The Rashbam explains that since Hakadosh Boruch Hu chose to convey His berachos to the Jewish people through the seventh word, shalom, no harm in the world can come of it. The Gemara brings Rabbah and Rav Yosef who applied the fifth word of the middle berachah, ויחנך, the same way, and that therefore there is no harm when drinking six cups, and then Abaye and Rava applied the third word, וישמרך, in the first berachah similarly, and that there is therefore no harm in drinking four cups.

Reish Lakish says: זאת אומרת מצות צריכות כוונה – This teaches that mitzvos need kavanah, meaning, it is because the lettuce eaten as karpas was not eaten with intent to fulfill the mitzvah of maror that the mitzvah was not fulfilled and lettuce must be eaten again specifically as maror.The Gemara dismisses this proof by suggesting a different explanation for lettuce being eaten a second time, after the mitzvah of maror was fulfilled during “karpas”: כי היכי דליהוי היכירא לתינוקות – So that there will be a distinguishing factor for the children.

This is not the case where one food is eaten for a mitzvah d’Oraysa and the other for a mitzvah deRabbanon.  The Gemara identifies the מאן דאמר who holds מצות אין מבטלות זו את זו as Hillel, who would eat Korban Pesach, Matzah, and Maror together.

Dovid will say to them, אני אברך ולי נאה לברך – I shall recite Bircas HaMazon and it is fitting for me to recite it, as it says in the passuk, כוס ישועות אשא ובשם ה' אקרא – I shall raise the cup of salvations, and the name of Hashem I will invoke. The Maharsha explains that since Dovid built Yerushalayim and his son Shlomo built the Beis Hamikdash, he was qualified to thank Hashem for the major themes of Bircas HaMazon such as the bris milah, the Torah, Eretz Yisroel, Yerushalayim and the Beis Hamikdash."

        "paragraph": "The next Mishnah states, אין מפטירין אחר הפסח אפיקומן – We may not conclude the seder meal, after eating the pesach offering, with afikomen. Rav said this means, שלא יעקרו מחבורה לחבורה – that after eating the pesach, [people] should not uproot themselves from their group to go join another group. The Rashbam explains that according to Rav, the word אפיקומן is a contraction of the words, אפיקו מנייכו, take out your (eating) utensils from here so we can go and eat somewhere else. Since, according to Rebbe Yehudah, the pesach cannot be eaten in two places, the Rabbanon prevented the eating of any food in another place, lest someone take along some of the pesach meat and eat it in the second place as well. According to Rav, if one remains in his original place, he may eat other foods as well. Shmuel says it means that after the pesach, one should not eat deserts, which were called אפיקומן, a contraction of אפיקו מיני – bring out a variety of sweets. The Rashbam explains that since kodshim should be eaten in the manner of kings, who do not ravenously, the pesach should be eaten late in the meal when one is no longer hungry. Eating after the pesach would suggest that one is still hungry. Tosafos say the reason is that the taste of the mitzvah should remain in our mouths."

The Gemara explains that maror is not d’Oraysa because the Torah requires that the Korban Pesach be eaten על מצות ומרורים – with matzos and bitter herbs, which we learn from this, בזמן דאיכא פסח יש מרור ובזמן דליכא פסח ליכא מרור – that when there is a Korban Pesach there is [a mitzvah d’Oraysa to eat] maror and when there is no Korban Pesach there is no [mitzvah d’Oraysa to eat] maror. Regarding matzah, on the other hand, a second passuk states, בערב תאכלו מצות – In the evening (that follows the fourteenth of Nissan) you shall eat matzos.Rav Acha bar Yaakov disagrees and says that matzah and maror are both deRabbanon nowadays, and the passuk, בערב תאכלו מצות - in the evening you shall eat matzos, is coming to teach that someone who is tamei, or on a distant road, who cannot partake of the pesach, still has a chiyuv d'Oraysa to eat matzah."

The Gemara explains that at that point it becomes נותר – leftover, because it may no longer be eaten, and נותר is metamei one’s hands mideRabbanon .Rav Yosef says that this Mishnah is only consistent with the view of Rebbe Elazar ben Azaryah, as it was taught in a Baraisa, that the passuk states, ואכלו את הבשר בלילה הזה – and they shall eat the meat on this night. Rebbe Elazar ben Azaryah says that it says, “on this night” and it says regarding the smiting of the firstborns, ועברתי בארץ מצרים בלילה הזה – And I will pass through the land of Mitzrayim on this night. Just as the makos bechoros refers to the night up until midnight, so too here, by the eating of the pesach, the proscribed time is up until midnight. Rebbe Akiva said to him, but is it not stated that you shall eat the pesach בחפזון – in haste, which implies that you shall eat the pesach up until the hour of haste, meaning until daybreak, when you will hasten to leave Mitzrayim? The passuk of בלילה הזה is coming to teach that one might have thought that the pesach could be eaten during the day, just like other kodshim. The passuk comes to teach, בלילה הוא נאכל ואינו נאכל ביום – it is eaten at night, but it is not eaten by day. We see from here that Rebbe Elazar ben Azaryah holds that it is an issur d’Oraysa to eat the pesach after chatzos."

The Gemara, as explained by Rashi, says that the two Amoraim did not disagree; one taught that Piggul is metamei the hands to prevent unscrupulous Kohanim from intentionally making a korban piggul so as to cause a loss to its owner. The Rabbanon therefore decreed tumah on the hands, to be matriach the Kohen to immerse them, which would serve as a deterrent. The other one taught that nosar is metamei the hands to prevent lazy Kohanim or Yisraelim from failing to eat the korban on time."

[Rashbam, quoting Tosefta, says that before eating the Korban Pesach one says, “Baruch Atah… asher kideshanu… le’echol haPesach,” and before eating the chagigah he says, “…le’echol hazevach.”] Rebbe Yishmael says:בירך ברכת הפסח פטר את של זבח בירך את של זבח לא פטר את של פסח – If one said the berachah for the Korban Pesach he exempted [himself from saying the blessing] for the [other] korban, but if one said the berachah for the [other] korban, he did not exempt [himself from saying the blessing] for the Korban Pesach. Rebbe Akiva says that neither blessing exempts a person from his obligation to say the other one.The Rashbam explains that the Torah requires that the blood of a Korban Pesach be poured on the wall of the mizbei’ach and that the blood of the chagigah be thrown on two corners of the mizbei’ach from a distance. The Gemara explains that both Tanna’im agree that לא שפיכה בכלל זריקה – pouring is not included in throwing, and the machlokes revolves around the issue of whether זריקה בכלל שפיכה – throwing is included in pouring. According to Rebbe Yishmael, throwing is included in pouring, so the berachah for the pesach exempts the berachah for the chagigah. Rebbe Akiva holds that throwing is not included in the pouring, requiring a separate berachah for the pesach and chagigah."

Does the Kohen recite it, דקמטי הנאה לידיה – as the physical benefit of this mitzvah, meaning the redemption money, reaches his hands, or does the father recite it דקא עביד מצוה – because he is performing the mitzvah? Rebbe Simlai did not have the answer and asked in the beis midrash, and was told, אבי הבן מברך שתים – The father of the son recites both berachos. The Gemara concludes, והלכתא אבי הבן מברך שתים – And the halachah is that the father of the son recites two berachos."
