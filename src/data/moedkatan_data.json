        "paragraph": "The opening Mishnah of the Masechta states: משקין בית השלחין במועד ובשביעית – One may water an irrigated field during Chol HaMoed and during Sheviis, בין במעיין שיצא בתחילה בין במעיין שלא יצא בתחילה – whether from a new spring that has just begun to flow, or from a spring that has not just begun to flow. Rashi explains that the field is on a mountain and needs to be irrigated constantly, to avoid a הפסד גדול – a large financial loss. Therefore, it is permitted to water the field on Chol HaMoed, because the Rabbis permitted melachah on Chol HaMoed to prevent financial loss, as the passuk states: ששת ימים תאכל מצות וביום השביעי עצרת לה' אלקיך – Six days you shall eat matzos, and the seventh day is an atzeres, (a cessation), to Hashem your G-d. We learn from here, that just as on the seventh day of Pesach there is a cessation of melachah, so too on the six days of Pesach there is a cessation of melachah. One might think that just as on the seventh day there is a complete cessation of melachah, the same should apply to the six days. Therefore, the Torah teaches השביעי – the seventh day, to teach that it is only the seventh day when there is a complete cessation. In regard to the other six days, the passuk is giving the Chochomim the authority to determine which melachah is forbidden and which is not, and they determined that melachah is permitted in the case of a financial loss."

Rav Pappa said it is Rebbe Yehudah, for it was taught in a Baraisa: Rebbe Meir holds that one may water even a שדה בית הבעל – a rain watered field, from a newly emerging spring, whereas Rebbe Yehudah holds:  אין משקין אלא שדה בית השלחין שחרבה – One may only irrigate an irrigated field that dried up , which Abaye explains that it means dried up from one spring and another spring emerged from which it can be watered,  and one may not clean out an irrigation canal from his garden and ruin on Chol HaMoed.

Abaye answered that the Mishnah is going according to Rebbe, who holds that shemittah nowadays is only a d’Rabbanon, and since there would be a loss  if one does not water his irrigated field on shemittah, the Rabbanon permitted it. Rava said that you can even say that the Mishnah is going according to the Rabbanon, who hold that shemittah nowadays is a d’Oraysa, אבות אסר רחמנא תולדות לא אסר רחמנא – the Torah only prohibits avos, not toldos. Since watering is considered a toldah, it is permitted. The Gemara brings the source that toldos are not prohibited mid’Oraysa, for the passuk states: \"ובשנה השביעית שבת שבתון יהיה לארץ...שדך אל תזרע וכרמך לא תזמר\" – But in the seventh year it will be a Shabbos Shabbason for the land…your field you should not plant nor your vineyards you shall not prune. The passuk continues and mentions harvesting and picking grapes. The Gemara notes that pruning is included in the melachah of sowing, and picking grapes is included in the melachah of harvesting. This teaches us that only these specific toldos are prohibited mid’Oraysa, but not others."

Rava qualifies the machlokes. In a case where the person was never examined by a Kohen, they both agree that he should not be checked, because a decision can only worsen his situation. They also agree that if a person is בהסגר ראשון – his first confinement, he should be examined, because an examination can possibly improve his situation if he is rendered tahor. They disagree only in the case of someone at the end of his second confinement, where his situation will improve if he is tahor and worsen if he is tamei, as he will then be distressed on becoming aמצורע מוחלט . Rebbe Meir holds, בכהן תליא מילתא – that the determination of becoming a מצורע מוחלט is dependent on the Kohen’s decision. If he is tahor, the Kohen tells him, “Tahor,” and if he is tamei then שתיק – the Kohen is silent, which prevents the person from being declared a מצורע מוחלט.

The Gemara asks what the problem is for someone having simchah on a chag, and the Gemara brings four answers.- Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel, לפי שאין מערבין שמחה בשמחה – because we do not mix one simchah with another. Rashi explains that one should be completely engaged in the simchah of the chag alone.- Rabbah bar Rav Huna said: מפני שמניח שמחת הרגל ועוסק בשמחת אשתו – Because the chosson will leave aside the simchah of the chag and be involved in the simchah of his wife. Rav Daniel bar Ketina said the source for this is: \"ושמחת בחגך\" בחגך ולא באשתך – And you shall rejoice in your chag, in your chag and not in your wife.- Ullah said: מפני הטורח – because it would involve a lot tircha for the chosson- Rebbe Yitzchak Nafcha said:מפני ביטול פריה ורביה  - because it would result in not fulfilling the mitzvah of pru u’rvu.

They celebrated for seven days before Succos and then celebrated for seven days during Succos, for a total of fourteen days.

If he opened two gates of water, one at a higher elevation to let the water in and the second at a lower elevation to let the water out, then his intent is to catch fish.

The Gemara then questions whether a metzora may engage in learning, and brings a Baraisa that teaches from the pesukim, that just as the Jews received the Torah באימה וביראה וברתת – with awe, fear and trembling, so too the Torah is taught with awe, fear and trembling. This comes to teach that zavim, metzoras, and those who had relations with niddos, are permitted to learn, ובעלי קרין אסורין – and baalei keri may not, for their tumah resulted from levity."

Rav Yehudah asked Rabbah bar bar Chanah if he had heard from his rebbeim any guidance on this, and he answered that Rebbe Yochanan said: What is pshat in that which is written: \"כי שפתי כהן ישמרו דעת ותורה יבקשו מפיהו\" – For the lips of the Kohen should guard knowledge and people should seek teaching from his mouth, \"כי מלאך ה' צבקות הוא\" – because he is a malach of Hashem of Hosts.

Rashi explains that just as the fat is absorbed into the oven and never leaves, so too the excommunication has a damaging impact that never leaves the one who is excommunicated. Shmuel’s understanding differs from the opinion of Reish Lakish, who said: כשם שנכנסת במאתים וארבעים ושמונה איברים כך כשהיא יוצאה יוצאה ממאתים וארבעים ושמונה איברים – Just as excommunication enters the two-hundred and forty-eight limbs of a person, so too when it leaves, it leaves the two hundred and forty-eight limbs of a person.

We can learn from this that it is permitted to cut nails on Chol HaMoed, and that biting nails is not repulsive, and that it is permitted to throw the cuttings into a public area. The Gemara asks if this is so, for it was taught in a Baraisa: שלשה דברים נאמרו בצפרנים – Three things were said in respect to nails, הקוברן צדיק שורפן חסיד זורקן רשע – One who buries them is a Tzadik, one who burns them is chasid, and one who throws them into a public place is a rasha. The Gemara explains that the reason for not throwing them into a public area is: שמא תעבור עליהן אשה עוברה ותפיל – that perhaps a pregnant woman might pass over them and miscarry. The Ran explains that her disgust at seeing them might affect her physically, causing her to miscarry. Alternatively, they might cause a miscarriage supernaturally.

If a woman is destined for a certain man, how could another come and marry her? The Gemara answers that Shmuel means, שמא יקדמנו אחר ברחמים – that another man may preempt him through tefillah. This means, that someone might daven for her to die. The following incident is brought to illustrate this. Rava once heard a man davening that he should be able to marry a certain woman, and he told him not to daven for this. If she is destined for him, he will marry her, and if not, his prayer will not be answered, כפרת בה' – “and you will deny Hashem.” Rashi explains that he will conclude that tefillah is not effective. Rava later heard the man daven that either he should die before she gets married , so he should not see her married to another, or that she should die before him , so he should not see her marry.

Rashi explains that the minhag was for the body to be taken from Bavel to Eretz Yisroel for burial. Those who escorted it until Eretz Yisroel would begin shivah after סתימת הגולל – when the top of the aron is closed over it, and those who did not escort the deceased all the way to burial, would begin their shivah as soon as they took leave of the body, meaning, at the gates of the entrance of the city, even though the burial may not take place for a few days."

Rabbah bar bar Chanah said: When the Baraisa permitted a mourner, for someone other than a parent, to enter a house of celebration after thirty days, it was referring to שמחת מריעות – a simchah of friendship, which Rashi defines as a nice meal that friends make for one another, but not to a seudah of simchah, such as a chasunah.

The Gemara asks what the meaning is of “three and four stanzas,” and explains that when Yehokayim was told that Yirmiyahu had written sefer Kinnos, he asked what was in it. They recited the first passuk, \"איכה ישבה בדד\" – Alas, she sits in solitude. He replied that he is the king and will stay in power even if the Jews go into galus. After each of the next three pesukim were read, he responded the same way. But when they read the fifth passuk that states \"היו צריה לראש\" – Her adversaries have become her master, he asked who said this, and was told that the passuk continues, \"כי ה' הוגה על רב פשעיה\" – for Hashem has spoken of her because of her many transgressions.

        "paragraph": "Rebbe Levi bar Chayasa said: הנפטר מן המת לא יאמר לו לך לשלום – One who takes leave of a dead person should not say to him, “Go to peace,” אלא לך בשלום – but “Go in peace.” הנפטר מן החי לא יאמר לו לך בשלום אלא לך לשלום – One who takes leave of a living person should not say, “Go in peace,” but “Go to peace.” The source for saying \"לך בשלום\" – “Go in peace” to a dead person, is the passuk where Hakadosh Boruch Hu said to Avraham, \"ואתה תבוא אל אבתיך בשלום\" – You shall come to your ancestors in peace. The source for not saying \"לך בשלום  to the living, but rather saying \"לך לשלום\" – “Go to peace,” is learned from when Dovid said to Avshalom, “לך בשלום”,  he went and was hanged, whereas when Yisro said to Moshe,\"לך לשלום\" , he went and was successful."

        "paragraph": "Rebbe Levi said: כל היוצא מבית הכנסת לבית המדרש ומבית המדרש לבית הכנסת – Whoever goes directly from shul to the Beis Hamidrash, and from the Beis Hamidrash to shul, זוכה ומקבל פני שכינה – will be zocheh to greet the face of the Shechinah, as it is written, \"ילכו מחיל אל חיל יראה אל אלקים בציון\" – They go from multitude to multitude, each appears before Hashem in Tziyon. The Maharsha (Brachos 64a) explains that one who davens with a multitude and learns with a multitude, meaning that he learns with a group and not alone, will be zocheh to be with the multitude of Jews appearing before Hashem in the Beis Hamikdash on the regalim. Rav Chiya bar Ashi said in the name of Rav, תלמידי חכמים אין להם מנוחה אפילו לעולם הבא – Talmidei Chochomim have no rest even in Olam Habah, as it is written, \"ילכו מחיל אל חיל יראה אל אלקים בציון\" – They go from multitude to multitude, each appears before Hashem in Tziyon. The multitudes in the passuk refers to those who will be learning Torah before Hashem in Olam Habah."
